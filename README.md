## FileStorage with Cloudinary / Fileuploading with multer - Under development

          
	               ### Correctly setting up the uploadRouter
	  
	               ### Understanding the concept of heroku file system and using bash to connect
	  
	  
	               ### Understand why we need proper storage - adding cloudinary.
	 
	 
	 	       ### Images are hosted on cloudinary, we can pass the images back with the response from our API, 
		
		
						  public_id: 'sample_remote',
						  version: 1336304441,
						  signature: 'abcde20044f8c8ba71fb31ebe81e9d72ec8763dd',
						  width: 100,
						  height: 100,
						  format: 'jpg',
						  resource_type: 'image',
						  url: 'http://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/v1336304441/sample_remote.jpg',
						  secure_url: 'https://d3jpl91pxevbkh.cloudfront.net/demo/image/upload/v1336304441/sample_remote.jpg' }
						  
			### Such as in the frontend we can do : 
						  
						  if (dish != null) {
						    return (
						      <Animatable.View animation="fadeInDown" duration={500} delay={200}>
							<Tile
							  height={480}
							  title={dish.name}
							  caption={dish.description}
							  featured
							  // eslint-disable-next-line global-require
							  imageSrc={{dish.url }}
							/>
	  
	  
	  
	  
	                 ###Understand how to upload a file correctly.
	  
	  
	  
			  ### #2 Registration image upload - using cloudinary

				https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/cloudinary#using-with-node-js

						Here’s a sample code that uses the Express framework for displaying an upload form, uploading an image to Cloudinary using streams and displaying a transformed version of the uploaded image:

						var express = require('express');
						var fs = require('fs');

						var cloudinary = require('cloudinary');

						var app = express.createServer(express.logger());
						app.use(express.bodyParser())

						app.get('/', function(req, res) {
						  res.send('<form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">'
						    + '<p>Public ID: <input type="text" name="title"/></p>'
						    + '<p>Image: <input type="file" name="image"/></p>'
						    + '<p><input type="submit" value="Upload"/></p>'
						    + '</form>');
						});

				Moving functionality from state based to work with backend API - fetching images from FS (heroku server + cloudinary) -  multer and store images serverside under user ID.

## Login functionality, registration


### Connecting Refresh Token and HTTP Cookie, connect backend to frontend login and register.

	 - Create Refresh Token Functionality - and API endpoint for this purpose.
	 - Implementing httpcookie to hold the JWT serverside so we can compare for a refresh token.
	 - Connecting backend to frontend - recieve token in browser as cookie

### #1 TODO ------> Favorite functionality for users** POST, GET, DELETE


	#Task 1 Mongoose populate GET request with dish data and user data.
	
	We will need a user ID (based on login show the correct favorites
	
	We will need a dish ID within the favorite listed so we know which dish it belongs to
	
	Files: favorites.js

			const mongoose = require('mongoose');
			const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

				user: {

			var Favorites = mongoose.model('Favorite', favoriteSchema);

			module.exports = Favorites;


		
		
	Files: favoritesRouter.js
	
	Favorites router has a get request already that populates both the user and dishes via its mongoose schema.
	
			 .get(cors.cors, /* authenticate.verifyUser, */ (req, res, next) => {
			 Favorites.findOne({ user: req.user._id })
				  .populate('user')
				.populate('dishes')

	

  	#Task 2  Mongoose populate DEL request with dish data and user data.
	
		We will need a user ID within the favorite listed so we know which user it belongs to

		We will need a dish ID within the favorite listed so we know which dish it belongs to
 

	#Task 3  Mongoose populate POST request with dish data and user data.
	
		We will need a user ID within the favorite listed so we know which user it belongs to

		We will need a dish ID within the favorite listed so we know which dish it belongs to

						.populate('dishes')

	

  	#Task 2  Mongoose populate DEL request with dish data and user data.
	
		We will need a user ID within the comment listed so we know which user it belongs to

		We will need a dish ID within the comment listed so we know which dish it belongs to





	#Task 3  Mongoose populate POST request with dish data and user data.
	
		We will need a user ID within the comment listed so we know which user it belongs to

## Admin Panel setup
________________________________________

###  Admin Panel Frontend structure


#### Admin GET all the registered users' information from the database and see it in the adminpanel


&nbsp;
&nbsp;   
&nbsp;


### Admin allowed / able to upload files, (MULTER and FS) such as images when creating new dishes. and see the temp picture in the adminpanel

		https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/cloudinary#using-with-node-js
		
				Here’s a sample code that uses the Express framework for displaying an upload form, uploading an image to Cloudinary using streams and displaying a transformed version of the uploaded image:

				var express = require('express');
				var fs = require('fs');

				var cloudinary = require('cloudinary');

				var app = express.createServer(express.logger());
				app.use(express.bodyParser())

				    + '<p><input type="submit" value="Upload"/></p>'
				    + '</form>');
				});

 # User manual (for myself mainly)

		use conFusion server

		db.users.find()

		Example: db.users.remove({username :"  "}, {justOne:true})


	###using mongoDBCompass
		￼

	###Register user 


		With CLI:

		Example: db.users.insert({“firstname: admin, “password”: “password”, “admin”: “false”})


		With Postman:

		https://localhost:3443/users/signup

![](https://imgur.com/IOLA55p.png)


	###Register admin 

		If we want to register an admin we have to do it either via CLI or via the mongoDB compass.


		 ###### Do not do it with CLI:

				// This makes the userdata appear as cleartext and not encrypted
				// hash and salt is automatically added by passportLocalMongooose.

				WORKS: db.users.insert({"username": "adminx", "password": "password", "admin": true})



		##### To register an user via postman 

				Via postman requires you to be logged in as admin

			
![](https://imgur.com/GTxXts2.png)

				Even if you pass admin as true via the postman call its not enabled.



		###### Via MongoDBCompass OR CLI ( Ensure only ADMINS can do it).


			To Update an existing user:

			db.users.update({“username”: “admin”}, {$set: {“admin”:true}})
